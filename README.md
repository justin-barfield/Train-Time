# Train-Time
This is the easier of two homeworks for section 7 of the GA Tech Coding Bootcamp. This will focus on building a small database that hold the names, destinations, arrival times, frequency, and how many minutes away imaginary trains are. "Admins" should be able to add new schedules and update/delete existing schedules. The times should update in real time.
